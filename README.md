# Sandals Interview

The goal of this assignment was to use the given URL and the data it fetched to create a simple UI.

To a random user, a website that has a UI similar to the original sandals website would be the easiset to navigate. This led to me trying to recerate the website to an extent. 
However I wanted to add a touch of something unique, hence the carousel. 

I chose to not use a framework since this is a very basic project. I did not want to complicate more than it needs to be. 

The reason I dynamically generated the HTML was to avoid having to hard code the sermon elements. It was also an attampt to mimic what it would have looked like if the website was fetching data from a database instead of a local JSON file.
